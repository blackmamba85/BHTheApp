    <p>
        We are a non-profit organization with heritage of Christian services and we seek to help people and the communities in Kentucky by providing the best quality of healthcare. We demonstrate our support and care through charity programs and donations of millions of dollars’ worth in healthcare to uninsured people. Not only we help people but also we are hoping to be recognized as the number one in healthcare in Kentucky.
